# Liseur

<!-- Personal fork notice — not present upstream. -->
> **This is a personal fork of [chmouel/liseur](https://github.com/chmouel/liseur).**
> It adds a **Simplified Chinese** translation (`values-b+zh+Hans`) and three
> bundled Chinese reading faces — 思源宋体 (Noto Serif SC), 思源黑体 (Noto Sans SC) and
> 霞鹜文楷 (LXGW WenKai) — all OFL, subset to the GB2312 **plus Big5** sets so a book
> in either script is covered (none of the Latin four carries a CJK glyph at all).
> The first two are the 宋 and 黑 of a Chinese font stack, the third the 楷.
> Also a CJK serif for the UI headings, an in-app language picker under
> *Settings ▸ Appearance*, a foldable table of contents whose sections open one
> at a time, this fork named under the upstream author on About, and a `cn`
> build variant that installs **beside** the official app (package
> `com.chmouel.liseur.cn`) instead of over it.
>
> Build it with `./gradlew assembleCn`; the APK lands in
> `app/build/outputs/apk/cn/app-cn.apk`.
>
> The translation itself is offered upstream — see
> [#280](https://github.com/chmouel/liseur/issues/280) and the `zh-hans` branch,
> which carries the translation and the Chinese store listing and **nothing else**.
> If this fork is behind upstream, `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main`.

## About Liseur

Liseur renders EPUBs with the Readium engine, in open typefaces (Literata,
Vollkorn, Atkinson Hyperlegible, Inter) or whatever the publisher shipped.
Four reading themes: Light, Sepia, Dark, OLED Black. Margins, line spacing,
brightness, and page-turn vs. continuous-scroll are adjustable per book or
library-wide. Auto-scroll runs at a set pace and continues across chapter
boundaries, with on-page controls to pause it, change the speed or stop.

A footer shows the page you are on, how much of the chapter is left, and
time remaining. Highlights, margin notes,
bookmarks, and dictionary lookups are inline; book-level notes live in the
notebook. Marking a passage offers three colours, and you tick which of
the six you want along with the colour new marks use. Footnotes open as a
card over the page rather than sending you to the back of the book.

The library is one shelf whatever the source: local folders, calibre-web,
Komga, BookOrbit, liseur-sync, or any OPDS catalog. Series are grouped into stacks tracking
reading order, progress, and missing volumes. "Download all books" fills the
shelf from a connected server in one go. An empty library also offers
free books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org): browse it
by language and shelf, and download the books you want before there is
anything to connect to.

Reading position syncs across devices through [calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web), [Komga](https://komga.org/),
[BookOrbit](https://bookorbit.app) or [liseur-sync](https://github.com/chmouel/liseur-sync),
down to the exact sentence on the last three. BookOrbit positions travel as EPUB CFIs.
A Custom connection can be an [OPDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Publication_Distribution_System) address, a kosync address, or both, so a plain catalog and a sync server that know nothing about each other still add up to a library that follows you. What each server can and cannot do is in [`docs/SERVER_CAPABILITIES.md`](docs/SERVER_CAPABILITIES.md).

With liseur-sync you get extras, like a per-device settings backup, and better insights of your reading progress across devices.

Two home-screen widgets show either the current book cover or your current
title and progress alongside reading hours for this calendar week, month
and year. Tap the title to read, or the totals to open the dashboard.
Neither widget needs configuration. The former library and combined-cover
widgets have been removed; their placements do not survive an upgrade.

No trackers, no analytics, no ads, no subscriptions. Liseur only talks to the
servers and dictionary sources you configure. See the
[privacy policy](https://chmouel.github.io/liseur/PRIVACY).

## Development

See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) for build instructions and architecture notes,
and [`docs/SERVER_CAPABILITIES.md`](docs/SERVER_CAPABILITIES.md) for what each
server exposes, what Liseur implements against it, and why the gaps remain.

## What's in a name?

**Liseur** ([li.zœʁ], *lee-ZUR*) is the French word for an avid reader or book lover. It sounds dignified, like the English word *leisure*.

Another inspiration was a painting by [Pierre-Auguste Renoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir) portraying [Claude Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet) as "Le Liseur":
