/**
 * Maps the app's reading preferences onto Readium's EPUB preferences.
 *
 * [theme] is passed in rather than read off [ReaderPrefs], which holds
 * the theme as it was *chosen* — and a choice of "follow the app" has no
 * colours until someone knows how the app is drawn. That is a question
 * only Compose can answer, so it is answered once at the top of the
 * reader and the palette arrives here settled.
 *
 * [scroll] is not part of [ReaderPrefs] either: it is answered per book
 * against an app-wide default, so it arrives from the reader's own flow
 * rather than from the shared reading settings.
 *
 * [css] is which stylesheet Readium will render this book with, which
 * decides whether the fine typography settings can be honoured at all —
 * see [requiresAdvancedStyles]. It is worked out from the publication,
 * so it is known here even though this runs before the navigator exists.
 *
 * **This function must not set `language`, `readingProgression` or
 * `verticalText`.** [readingCssFor] reproduces Readium's own resolution
 * of those three from publication metadata, which is only exact while
 * no preference overrides them. `ReaderPreferencesMapperTest` fails if
 * one ever does.

 * the theme's pale ink on a pale blue block — barely readable, which is
 * what issue #117 reported.
 *
 * The answer is one translucent colour rather than four opaque ones. The
 * blend happens in the page, against whichever background the theme has
 * put there, so white, beige, dark grey and black each get their own
 * shade for free — and so does any theme added later. It also has to be
 * this way round: RS properties are injected when a resource loads, from
 * the configuration the navigator fragment was *built* with, so a value
 * chosen per theme could only follow a theme changed mid-book by
 * rebuilding the fragment under the reader — at every tap of the theme
 * buttons, and again when the app turns itself dark at dusk.
 *
 * Over white it lands within a couple of points of the blue that was
 * there before, so the two themes nobody complained about keep the look
 * they had.
 *
 * Carried as a raw override rather than through
 * `RsProperties.selectionBackgroundColor`, whose `Color.Hex` refuses
 * anything but three or six hex digits — an alpha channel among them.
 * Spelled `rgba()` rather than `#4A90E266` because eight-digit hex only
 * became valid in Chromium 62 and the WebView that shipped with our
 * oldest supported Android was 60: there, the hex form parses as a
 * custom property and then fails as a colour, which would leave exactly

 * a `min-width: 60em` media query, so on anything narrower than a large
 * tablet — a 7" e-ink reader, a phone held sideways — asking for two
 * columns through preferences alone does nothing. Setting the RS
 * properties instead reaches the unconditional `:root` rule.
 *
 * The column width has to go with it. `column-count` is a ceiling, not a
 * demand — the used count is the smaller of it and what the column width
 * allows — and Readium's default `--RS__colWidth` is 45em, so two columns
 * only actually appear on a screen wide enough for 90em of text. Above
 * 60em Readium answers this by setting the width to `auto`; the Kotlin
 * `Length` has no `auto`, so half the viewport does the same job: two
 * columns fit at any width, and the ceiling stops it becoming three.
 * Nothing below [WidthClass.MEDIUM] ever gets here, because
 * [effectiveFor] has already turned it back into Auto.
 *
 * These are read when the book opens rather than watched, so a change
 * lands on the next book; the preference above covers the live case on
 * screens wide enough for it.
 *
 * The system's own selection menu is refused so the app can put its own
 * bar next to the words instead: the platform bar floats where it likes,
 * offers actions a book has no use for, and cannot show highlight colours.
 * Taking it over means taking on what it did for free, so the callback
 * reports the selection on every change and its disappearance on the way
 * out — see the callback itself for why both matter. What the selection
 * is *painted* in is set here too; see [SELECTION_BACKGROUND].
 *
 * [scroll] switches off Readium's page turns, which in a scrolled book
 * are a whole chapter at a time: a sideways swipe would throw the reader
 * out of the chapter they are in the middle of, and the volume keys are
 * given a screenful of scrolling instead (see `PageTurner`).
