 * which are neutrals mixed towards the baseline purple. Nothing looked
 * obviously broken because nothing was obviously wrong: the page was
 * warm and the menus, sheets, cards and scrolled app bars sitting on it
 * were faintly lilac, which reads as the app being slightly grubby
 * rather than as a bug. The containers below are what fixes that.
